During this internship, we explore many aspect of security proof of the cryptographic protocols
and we have constructed and improved several existing rerandomizable encryption scheme.
And also our RCCA encryption scheme is based on the SXDH assumption which is a well studied and general believed assumption,
this means we don't need the symmetric pairing for our construction which is not very efficient.
However, there are many questions left open. Can we construct efficient protocol for larger family of homomorphic encryption scheme.
