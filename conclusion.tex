During this internship, we explore many aspect of security proof of the cryptographic protocols
and we have constructed and improved several existing rerandomizable encryption schemes.
And also our RCCA encryption scheme is based on the SXDH assumption which is a well studied and general believed assumption,
this means we don't need the symmetric pairing for our construction which is not very efficient.
However, there are many questions left open. Can we construct efficient protocol for larger family of homomorphic encryption scheme?
Can we use the same idea to improve the efficiency but still statistical unlinkable?

For the efficiency evaluation,
our RCCA scheme is based on SXDH the ciphertext's size is $39\G + 20 \hat{\G}$,
and the most efficient instantiation as we know is $93\G$ under the DLIN assumption and $49\G + 20\hat{\G}$ under SXDH assumption.
However we must point out that our scheme is computational unlinkable and the previous construction by Chase \etal~\cite{DBLP:conf/eurocrypt/ChaseKLM12} is statistical unlinkable.
And our Structure-Preserving Publicly Verifiable CCA encryption scheme has $16 \G + 11 \hat{\G}$ elements and the known most efficient such scheme has ciphertext's size as $321\G$ elements.
